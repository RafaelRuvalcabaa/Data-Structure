# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms — Self-Taught Journey

> A self-directed learning repository documenting my progression in Data Structures and Algorithms through hands-on implementation.

---

## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository represents my **independent study journey** in Data Structures and Algorithms.

All implementations are written as part of my personal practice process to deeply understand:

- Core data structures
- Graph traversal techniques
- Recursion fundamentals
- Algorithmic thinking

This is not a finished framework — it is an evolving learning repository that grows as my knowledge expands.

New topics will be added progressively as I continue studying.
